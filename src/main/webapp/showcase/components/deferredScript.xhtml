			The <strong>&lt;o:deferredScript&gt;</strong> is a component which defers the loading of the given script resource to the window
			load event. In other words, the given script resource is only loaded when the window is really finished with loading.
			So, the enduser can start working with the webpage without waiting for the additional scripts to be loaded. Usually,
			it are those kind of scripts which are just for progressive enhancement and thus not essential for the functioning
			of the webpage.
		</p>
		<p>
			This will give bonus points with among others the Google PageSpeed tool, on the contrary to placing the script at
			bottom of body, or using <code>defer="true"</code> or even <code>async="true"</code>.
		</p>

		<h3>Usage</h3>
		<p>
			Just use it the same way as a <code>&lt;h:outputScript&gt;</code>, with a <code>library</code> and <code>name</code>.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-xhtml">
&lt;o:deferredScript library="yourlibrary" name="scripts/filename.js" /&gt;
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			You can use the optional <code>onbegin</code>, <code>onsuccess</code> and <code>onerror</code> attributes 
			to declare JavaScript code which needs to be executed respectively right before the script is loaded, 
			right after the script is successfully loaded, and/or when the script loading failed.
		</p>

		<h3>Demo</h3>
		<c:set var="resourceBaseURL" value="#{request.contextPath}/javax.faces.resource/" />
		<p>
			This component is also  
			<a href="https://github.com/omnifaces/showcase/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/templates/showcase.xhtml">used</a>
			on this showcase web application on the two JS files 
			<a href="#{resourceBaseURL}js/prettify.js.xhtml?ln=showcase">prettify.js</a> and
			<a href="#{resourceBaseURL}js/onload.js.xhtml?ln=showcase">onload.js</a>.
			Rightclick the page and <i>View Source</i> and find the <code>OmniFaces.DeferredScript.add</code> call at the bottom of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
			Note that this showcase application is also using the 
			<h:link outcome="/resourcehandlers/CombinedResourceHandler"><code>CombinedResourceHandler</code></h:link>
			which transparently recognizes and combines the deferred script resources into a single resource as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the technically interested, the unminified version of the <code>OmniFaces.DeferredScript</code> script is available for viewing 
			<a href="#{resource['omnifaces:deferredscript.unminified.js']}">here</a> (note you do not need to include it yourself!).
		</p>

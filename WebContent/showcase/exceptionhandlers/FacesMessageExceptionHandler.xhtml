		<p>
			This exception handler will add every exception as a global FATAL faces message.
		</p>

		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<p>
			This handler must be registered by a factory as follows in <code>faces-config.xml</code> in order to get it to run:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-xml">
&lt;factory&gt;
    &lt;exception-handler-factory&gt;org.omnifaces.exceptionhandler.FacesMessageExceptionHandlerFactory&lt;/exception-handler-factory&gt;
&lt;/factory&gt;
		</code></pre>

		<h3>Note</h3>
		<p>
			It's your own responsibility to make sure that the faces messages are being shown. Make sure
			that there's a <code>&lt;h:messages&gt;</code> or any equivalent component (OmniFaces, PrimeFaces, etc) present
			in the view and that it can handle global messages and that it's explicitly or automatically updated in case of ajax
			requests. Also make sure that you don't have bugs in rendering of your views. This exception handler is not capable
			of handling exceptions during render response. It will fail silently.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Demo</h3>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, this showcase application has already a 
			<h:link outcome="FullAjaxExceptionHandler"><code>FullAjaxExceptionHandler</code></h:link> configured and 
			therefore it's not possible to demo another exception handler.

		<p>
			The <code>&lt;o:resourceInclude&gt;</code> component can be used to catch the output from a JSP or Servlet
			resource and render it as output to the JSF writer. In effect, this allows you to include both Servlets and
			JSP pages in e.g. Facelets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that this isn't recommended as a lasting solution, but it might ease a migration from legacy JSP with
			smelly scriptlets and all on them to a more sane and modern Facelets application.

	<!-- This is only needed for the "Passing listener method with zero arguments" test.
		
		The problem is that JSF copies a method expression based on the literal EL expression only, which
		means the variable mapper isn't copied. As it's the variable mapper that contain the reference
		to our method, this copied expression can't be resolved.
		
		A workaround is to put the method into request scope with nested visibility via the ui:repeat trick.
